# Meridian

**Autonomous Meteora DLMM liquidity management agent for Solana, powered by LLMs.**

**Links:** [Website](https://agentmeridian.xyz) | [Telegram](https://t.me/agentmeridian) | [X](https://x.com/meridian_agent)

Meridian runs continuous screening and management cycles, deploying capital into high-quality Meteora DLMM pools and closing positions based on live PnL, yield, and range data. It learns from every position it closes.

---

## What it does

- **Screens pools** — scans Meteora DLMM pools against configurable thresholds (fee/TVL ratio, organic score, holder count, mcap, bin step) and surfaces high-quality opportunities
- **Manages positions** — monitors, claims fees, and closes LP positions autonomously; decides to STAY, CLOSE, or REDEPLOY based on live data
- **Learns from performance** — studies top LPers in target pools, saves structured lessons, and evolves screening thresholds based on closed position history
- **Discord signals** — optional Discord listener watches LP Army channels for Solana token calls and queues them for screening
- **Telegram chat** — full agent chat via Telegram, plus cycle reports and OOR alerts
- **Claude Code integration** — run AI-powered screening and management directly from your terminal using Claude Code slash commands

---

## How it works

Meridian runs a **ReAct agent loop** — each cycle the LLM reasons over live data, calls tools, and acts. Two specialized agents run on independent cron schedules:

| Agent | Default interval | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Screening Agent** | Every 30 min | Pool screening — finds and deploys into the best candidate |
| **Management Agent** | Every 10 min | Position management — evaluates each open position and acts |

### Agent harness

Meridian's agent harness is the runtime wrapper around every autonomous cycle. It gives both **main** and **experimental** agents the same control loop: load live state, inject relevant memory, expose only role-appropriate tools, execute tool calls, and return a readable cycle report.

The harness also keeps a structured decision log in `decision-log.json` for deployments, closes, skips, and no-deploy outcomes. Each entry records the actor, pool or position, summary, reason, key risks, metrics, and rejected alternatives. Recent decisions are injected back into the system prompt and are available through `get_recent_decisions`, so the agent can answer "why did you deploy?", "why did you close?", or "why did you skip?" without guessing after the fact.

**Data sources:**
- `@meteora-ag/dlmm` SDK — on-chain position data, active bin, deploy/close transactions
- Meteora DLMM PnL API — position yield, fee accrual, PnL
- Pool screening API — fee/TVL ratios, volume, organic scores, holder counts
- Jupiter API — token audit, mcap, launchpad, price stats

Agents are powered via **OpenRouter** and can be swapped for any compatible model.

---

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key
- Solana wallet (base58 private key)
- Solana RPC endpoint ([Helius](https://helius.xyz) recommended)
- Telegram bot token (optional)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI (optional, for terminal slash commands)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yunus-0x/meridian
cd meridian
npm install
```

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
npm run setup
```

The wizard writes **both** files at the repo root:

| Goes in `.env` | Goes in `user-config.json` |
|---|---|
| `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `RPC_URL`, `HELIUS_API_KEY` | Risk preset, deploy size, max positions |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Strategy, screening filters, exit rules, trailing TP |
| `DRY_RUN` | Position sizing, cycle intervals, per-role LLM models, `solMode` |

`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` only needs to live in `.env` — setup also copies it to `user-config.json` when provided. Takes about 2 minutes.

**Or set up manually:**

Create `.env`:

```env
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_private_key
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_key          # for wallet balance lookups
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC...        # optional — for notifications + chat
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=                       # auto-filled on first message
DRY_RUN=true                            # set false for live trading
```

> Never put your private key or API keys in `user-config.json` — use `.env` only. Both files are gitignored.

Optional encrypted `.env` flow:

```bash
cp .env .env.raw
printf "replace-with-a-long-local-key\n" > .envrypt
npm run env:encrypt
```

Meridian loads envrypt-style encrypted values automatically. Keep `.env.raw` and `.envrypt` local; both are gitignored.

Copy config and edit as needed:

```bash
cp user-config.example.json user-config.json
```

See [Config reference](#config-reference) below.

### 3. Run

```bash
npm run dev    # dry run — no on-chain transactions
npm start      # live mode
```

On startup Meridian fetches your wallet balance, open positions, and top pool candidates, then begins autonomous cycles immediately.

### Run with PM2 (VPS / always-on)

PM2 is the recommended way to keep Telegram control online on a VPS. **Always start via the ecosystem file** so the working directory and script path stay pinned to the repo:

```bash
npm install
npm run pm2:start    # uses ecosystem.config.cjs — do NOT use "pm2 start index.js"
pm2 save
```

After `.env`, `user-config.json`, or code changes:

```bash
npm run pm2:restart  # re-reads .env on each restart
npm run pm2:logs
```

To update an existing PM2 install:

```bash
git pull
npm install
npm run pm2:restart
pm2 save
```

If a previous PM2 run was started incorrectly, reset it once:

```bash
pm2 delete meridian
npm run pm2:start
pm2 save
```

**PM2 vs `npm start`**

| | `npm start` | PM2 |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal | Interactive REPL | Headless daemon |
| Cron / Telegram | Starts after REPL banner | Starts immediately on boot |
| First screening | On cron schedule | May run one cycle right at startup |
| Best for | Local dev / testing | VPS / 24-7 operation |

On startup, logs show `Repo: ... | cwd: ... | PM2 id: ...`. **Repo and cwd must match.** If they differ, delete the process and use `npm run pm2:start` again.

**Common PM2 issues**

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Crash loop after `git pull` | `npm install` skipped | `npm install && npm run pm2:restart` |
| Missing wallet / API keys | Started with `pm2 start index.js` from wrong directory | `pm2 delete meridian && npm run pm2:start` |
| `.env` changes ignored | Old PM2 env snapshot | `npm run pm2:restart` (`.env` now overrides stale PM2 env) |
| Telegram `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (not chat ID) | Fix token in `.env`; if encrypted, ensure `.envrypt` exists |
| Telegram commands ignored | Missing/wrong `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Set in `.env` (or `telegramChatId` in `user-config.json`) |
| Duplicate polling / 409 errors | `nohup node index.js` or second PM2 instance running | Kill stray processes; run only one PM2 app |
| Encrypted env crash at boot | `# encrypted` lines without `.envrypt` key | Add `.envrypt` or use plain `.env` values |

Avoid `nohup node index.js` — it runs outside PM2 and can leave a duplicate Telegram poller fighting the managed process.

## Running modes

### Autonomous agent

```bash
npm start
```

Starts the full autonomous agent with cron-based screening + management cycles and an interactive REPL. The prompt shows a live countdown to the next cycle:

```
[manage: 8m 12s | screen: 24m 3s]
>
```

REPL commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/status` | Wallet balance and open positions |
| `/candidates` | Re-screen and display top pool candidates |
| `/learn` | Study top LPers across all current candidate pools |
| `/learn <pool_address>` | Study top LPers for a specific pool |
| `/thresholds` | Current screening thresholds and performance stats |
| `/evolve` | Trigger threshold evolution from performance data (needs 5+ closed positions) |
| `/stop` | Graceful shutdown |
| `<anything>` | Free-form chat — ask the agent anything, request actions, analyze pools |

---

### Claude Code terminal (recommended)

Install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and use it from inside the meridian directory. Claude Code has built-in agents and slash commands that use the `meridian` CLI under the hood.

```bash
cd meridian
claude
```

#### Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/screen` | Full AI screening cycle — checks Discord queue, reads config, fetches candidates, runs deep research, and deploys if a winner is found |
| `/manage` | Full AI management cycle — checks all positions, evaluates PnL, claims fees, closes OOR/losing positions |
| `/balance` | Check wallet SOL and token balances |
| `/positions` | List all open DLMM positions with range status |
| `/candidates` | Fetch and enrich top pool candidates (pool metrics + token audit + smart money) |
| `/study-pool` | Study top LPers on a specific pool |
| `/pool-ohlcv` | Fetch price/volume history for a pool |
| `/pool-compare` | Compare all Meteora DLMM pools for a token pair by APR, fee/TVL ratio, and volume |

#### Claude Code agents

Two specialized sub-agents run inside Claude Code:

**`screener`** — pool screening specialist. Invoke when you want to evaluate candidates, analyse token risk, or deploy a position. Has access to Jupiter token audit, smart-wallet checks, and all strategy logic.

**`manager`** — position management specialist. Invoke when reviewing open positions, assessing PnL, claiming fees, or closing positions.

To trigger an agent directly, just describe what you want:
```
> screen for new pools and deploy if you find something good
> review all my positions and close anything out of range
> what do you think of the SOL/BONK pool?
```

#### Loop mode

Run screening or management on a timer inside Claude Code:

```
/loop 30m /screen     # screen every 30 minutes
/loop 10m /manage     # manage every 10 minutes
```

---

### CLI (direct tool invocation)

The `meridian` CLI gives you direct access to every tool with JSON output — useful for scripting, debugging, or piping into other tools.

```bash
npm install -g .   # install globally (once)
meridian <command> [flags]
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
node cli.js <command> [flags]
```

```

**Token research**

```bash
meridian token-info --query <mint_or_symbol>
meridian token-holders --mint <addr> [--limit 20]
meridian token-narrative --mint <addr>
```

**Deploy & manage**

```bash
meridian deploy --pool <addr> --amount <sol> [--bins-below 69] [--bins-above 0] [--strategy bid_ask|spot|curve] [--dry-run]
meridian claim --position <addr>

```

**Agent cycles**

```bash
meridian screen [--dry-run] [--silent]   # one AI screening cycle
meridian manage [--dry-run] [--silent]   # one AI management cycle
meridian start [--dry-run]               # start autonomous agent with cron jobs
```

| `--silent` | Suppress Telegram notifications for this run |

---

## Discord listener

The Discord listener watches configured channels (e.g. LP Army) for Solana token calls and queues them as signals for the screener agent.

### Setup

```bash
cd discord-listener
npm install
```

Add to your root `.env`:

```env
DISCORD_USER_TOKEN=your_discord_account_token   # from browser DevTools → Network
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=the_server_id
DISCORD_CHANNEL_IDS=channel1,channel2            # comma-separated
DISCORD_MIN_FEES_SOL=5                           # minimum pool fees to pass pre-check
```

> This uses a selfbot (personal account automation, not a bot token). Use responsibly.

### Run

```bash
cd discord-listener
npm start
```

Or run it in a separate terminal alongside the main agent. Signals are written to `discord-signals.json` and picked up automatically by `/screen` and `node cli.js screen`.

### Signal pipeline

Each incoming token address passes through a pre-check pipeline before being queued:
1. **Dedup** — ignores addresses seen in the last 10 minutes
2. **Blacklist** — rejects blacklisted token mints
3. **Pool resolution** — resolves the address to a Meteora DLMM pool
4. **Rug check** — checks deployer against `deployer-blacklist.json`
5. **Fees check** — rejects pools below `DISCORD_MIN_FEES_SOL`

Signals that pass all checks are queued with status `pending`. The screener picks up pending signals and processes them as priority candidates before running the normal screening cycle.

### Deployer blacklist

Add known rug/farm deployer wallet addresses to `deployer-blacklist.json`:

```json
{
  "_note": "Known farm/rug deployers — add addresses to auto-reject their pools",
  "addresses": [
    "WaLLeTaDDressHere"
  ]
}
```

---

## Telegram

### Setup

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token
2. Add to `.env`:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token>
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=<your chat id>          # .env alone is enough; also saved to user-config by setup
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS=<user id>    # required for group/supergroup control
```

Meridian does **not** auto-register the first chat for safety — you must set `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` explicitly. For groups, also set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` or inbound commands are ignored.

`401 Unauthorized` in logs means a bad `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (invalid, revoked, or encrypted without a working `.envrypt` key) — not a chat ID problem.

### Notifications

Meridian sends notifications automatically for:
- Management cycle reports (reasoning + decisions)
- Screening cycle reports (what it found, whether it deployed)
- OOR alerts when a position leaves range past `outOfRangeWaitMinutes`
- Deploy: pair, amount, position address, tx hash
- Close: pair and PnL

### Telegram commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/positions` | List open positions with progress bar |
| `/close <n>` | Close position by list index |
| `/set <n> <note>` | Set a note on a position |

You can also chat freely via Telegram using the same interface as the REPL. Only allowed user IDs can issue commands in groups.

### Jupiter swap fee (referral)

Every token swap the agent makes (auto-swap base→SOL after a close/claim, manual `swap_token`) goes through **Jupiter Ultra**. Jupiter's referral program lets a referral wallet collect a small fee, expressed in **basis points (bps)** — `1 bps = 0.01%`, so `50 bps = 0.5%`. Meridian ships with this enabled by default.

**Settings** (env only — *not* in `user-config.json`):

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JUPITER_REFERRAL_ACCOUNT` | built-in account | A **Jupiter referral account** (not just any wallet). Create one on the Jupiter referral dashboard (`referral.jup.ag`) — it generates a referral account and the per-token fee accounts that actually collect the fee. Paste that referral account address here to collect the fee yourself. |
| `JUPITER_REFERRAL_FEE_BPS` | `50` | Fee in basis points. **Jupiter Ultra requires 50–255 bps** — values outside that range (or `0`) are ignored and the swap runs with no referral fee. |

```bash
# .env — collect the referral fee on your own Jupiter referral account
JUPITER_REFERRAL_ACCOUNT=<your-jupiter-referral-account>
JUPITER_REFERRAL_FEE_BPS=50
```

**To turn the referral off**, just remove/blank it — set `JUPITER_REFERRAL_ACCOUNT=` (empty) **or** `JUPITER_REFERRAL_FEE_BPS=0`. Either one drops the referral and the swap proceeds at Jupiter's normal rate. The referral is also silently dropped if the fee is below `50`, above `255`, or the account isn't a valid Solana address (`tools/wallet.js#getJupiterReferralParams`). **`50` is the minimum Jupiter allows and the Meridian default.**

> If you leave the referral enabled on the **built-in default account**, the fee goes toward **Meridian server maintenance** (HiveMind, Agent Meridian API, hosting). Override `JUPITER_REFERRAL_ACCOUNT` with your own Jupiter referral account to collect it yourself instead, or disable it entirely as above. Either way, on new tokens (<24h) it's the same 0.5% Jupiter charges regardless — so leaving the default on costs you nothing extra there.

> **Why 50 bps is effectively free on new tokens.** Jupiter's own platform fee already varies by pair — and for **new tokens (within 24h of token age) Jupiter charges 50 bps (0.5%)** on its UI regardless. So on those tokens the swap costs the same 0.5% **whether or not you attach a referral** — adding the referral just redirects that fee to your wallet instead of leaving it at Jupiter's default. (Jupiter's full platform-fee schedule: `0` bps buying Jupiter tokens / pegged LST-LST & stable-stable, `2` SOL-stable, `5` LST-stable, `10` everything else, `50` new tokens <24h.)

---

## How it learns

### Lessons

After every closed position the agent runs `studyTopLPers` on candidate pools, analyzes on-chain behavior of top performers (hold duration, entry/exit timing, win rates), and saves concrete lessons. Lessons are injected into subsequent agent cycles as part of the system context.

Add a lesson manually:
```bash
node cli.js lessons add "Never deploy into pump.fun tokens under 2h old"
```

### Threshold evolution

After 5+ positions have been closed, run:
```bash
node cli.js evolve
```

This analyzes closed position performance (win rate, avg PnL, fee yields) and automatically adjusts screening thresholds in `user-config.json`. Changes take effect immediately.

---

## HiveMind

HiveMind sync uses Agent Meridian at `https://api.agentmeridian.xyz` by default with the built-in public key. Agents can register, pull shared lessons/presets, and push learning events without a separate registration flow.

**What you get:**
- Shared lessons from other Meridian agents
- Strategy presets and crowd performance context
- Role-aware lessons injected into future screener/manager prompts when `hiveMindPullMode` is `auto`

**What you share:**
- Lessons from `lessons.json`
- Closed-position performance events: pool, pool name, base mint, strategy, close reason, PnL, fees, and hold time
- Agent heartbeat metadata: agent ID, version, timestamp, and basic capability flags
- **Private keys and wallet balances are never sent**

HiveMind failures are non-blocking. If Agent Meridian is unavailable, the agent logs a warning and keeps running.

### Setup

No manual HiveMind registration command is required for the shared Agent Meridian setup. `agentId` is generated automatically on startup if it is missing.

To use a private HiveMind API key, check the Telegram announcement channel and set it as `hiveMindApiKey`.

Relevant config fields:

```json
{
  "agentId": "",
  "hiveMindUrl": "",
  "hiveMindApiKey": "",
  "hiveMindPullMode": "auto"
}
```

Blank `hiveMindUrl` and `hiveMindApiKey` values intentionally fall back to the Agent Meridian defaults. Set `hiveMindPullMode` to `manual` if you do not want shared lessons and presets pulled automatically.

### Disable

There is currently no empty-string disable path for HiveMind; blank values fall back to the built-in Agent Meridian defaults. A true off switch should be implemented as an explicit config flag before documenting HiveMind as disabled by clearing fields.

## Using a local model (LM Studio)

```env
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
LLM_API_KEY=lm-studio
LLM_MODEL=your-local-model-name
```

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works.
